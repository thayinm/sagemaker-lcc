## SageMaker Lifecycle Config Scripts
This repository contains SageMaker LCC scripts that were adapted from the original AWS [repository](https://github.com/aws-samples/sagemaker-studio-lifecycle-config-examples). Since the original scripts were made for Studio Classic and Kernel Gateway, these new scripts should work with the new spaces (JupyterLab and CodeEditor)
